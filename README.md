SoulSync: Connecting Through Music!

Project Goal: Music is a trivial yet universal happiness that spans across multiple generations and people of all backgrounds. 
Because of this, we wanted to look into Spotify's data to understand the preferences of those who listen to music like we do.

Audience this project serves: This project serves all those who are actively using Spotify and/or love music, whether as a casual listener or professional.
